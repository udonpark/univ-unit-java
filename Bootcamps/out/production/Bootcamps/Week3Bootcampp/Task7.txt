Here is my approach to Task 7.

I would like to add a new method that prints a list of all buyers without any duplicates.

I will be adding a new method printBuyers() in the AutoShowroom class. Because this is where a similar method
displayCars() exist for printing car information. Furthermore, I can access to both Bid and Buyer class to obtain
required variables and data.
Buyers have 3 attributes, buyerId, givenName and familyName.
In order to distinguish, I am focusing on Buyer ID to compare, because people could have same exact name but can be different.
Buyer ID is for unique to everyone. But I will record the whole Buyer object, because I want to print whole Buyer later on.
NOTE: I could just use description() in Buyer class to obtain whole string, but since there can be a type during the
I/O, and one character mistake could lead to be identified as different person. So for consistency I am using this method.

The Framework of this method is:
    1) Create an ArrayList buyerList to store Buyer class. It won't be an array since we still don't know how many buyers they are in total.
    I would like to keep it dynamic to add or remove Buyer object freely.
    2) Use for loop to iterate through all Car instances. Take note of the index as we use it inside the loop
    to locate which car we are taking information from.
    3) For each Car, use for loop to iterate through all Bids, and for each Bids, access Buyer to add it into buyerList.
    However, only add to it the buyerList if the new Buyer ID is not already contained inside the IDs. I will implement
    pseudocode later on.
    NOTE: Mutator for buyerId, getBuyerId() has to be added in Buyer class to compare.
    4) Now buyerList contains all non-duplicate Buyers, so print them one by one.

The pseudocode(Very rough one):

declare and initialize buyerList, ArrayList<Buyer>
boolean isDuplicate = false // this is an indicator whether a buyer already exists or not

for i=0 to carArray.size() do
    for j=0 to carArray(i).getBid().max do // go through all j while bids exist in the arraylist
        newBuyer = carArray(i).getBid(j).getBuyer() // object extracted. now check if it meets cond.
        for k to buyerList.size() do
            if buyerList(k).getBuyerId() == newBuyer.getBuyerId() then
                isDuplicate == true  // break from this for loop and go look for next buyer
        if not isDuplicate then
            buyerList.add(newBuyer)

for i=0 to buyerList.size() do
    print line buyerList(i).description()

// and now the print is complete!
